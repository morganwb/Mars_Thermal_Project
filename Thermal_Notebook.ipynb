    "For a variety of reasons, including proximity to the sun and atmospheric and regolith composition, Mars is the number one candidate body in the solar system for future human colonization. Unfortunately, it is currently highly inhospitable to human life, partially due to the extreme surface temperatures that can range from $-143^{\\circ} C$ and $35^{\\circ} C$. We use simple climate models to find the amount of energy that would be required to liberate enough CO2 to kickstart a greenhous effect and warm the planet."
